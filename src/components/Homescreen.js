              Welcome to Transformed Within, LLC! Transformed Within is a telehealth counseling service
              designed for you to courageously address some of lifeâ€™s toughest struggles while resting
              peacefully knowing you are receiving professional, non-judgmental treatment.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Each person who seeks counseling has a different story to tell and different stressors to
              address, yet each person shares at least one goal: living a healthier, happier life.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              At Transformed Within, you will walk alongside a licensed counselor who seeks to treat the
              whole person: mind, body, and spirit. You will have the opportunity to receive faith-based,
              Christian counseling, which respects both the gift and tool of your faith.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Explore the services we have to offer, and may your counseling experience be one you can look
              forward to!
