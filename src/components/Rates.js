Initial sessions are booked for 90 minutes, with no additional charge, to allow proper review of all intake paperwork in addition to gathering background information and discussing goals. If longer sessions are desired and agreed upon by both client and counselor, rates will be adjusted accordingly. Payment is due at the time of each session and can be paid through the billing service within Therapy Notes. </h2>

You may choose to request a receipt for services if you would like to personally submit the charge to your insurance company for possible reimbursement. You will need to check with your insurance company to see if telehealth sessions are covered as well as what information about the services is needed for filing the claim.
