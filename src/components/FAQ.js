                <h2 className='question'>Does telehealth work?</h2>
                <h2 className='answer'>Yes! Research shows that telehealth can be just as effective as in-person therapy in many cases. It also provides the convenience of receiving mental health services more easily in a busy schedule or while out of town (though still within state lines). There are some circumstances where telehealth may not be appropriate for a particular client or presenting issue. By speaking with your counselor, you can discuss the pros and cons to see if telehealth seems like the right fit for you.</h2>
                <h2 className='question'>What if I decide I no longer want to continue services?</h2>
                <h2 className='answer'>There are many valid reasons for discontinuing counseling services: schedule changes, feeling you’re not making progress towards your goals, financial changes, not feeling the counselor-client relationship is the right fit for you, moving to a different state, etc. If you get to a point where you need to adjust or discontinue counseling, please discuss this with your counselor. Many circumstances can be looked at and adjustments made accordingly that may make it possible for you to continue services if that is what you desire. If you would like to terminate therapy, talking to your counselor about the reasons can allow the natural summary, reflection, take-away, and termination process to occur while avoiding abrupt endings that may leave things unfinished or having a sense of lack of closure. Your counselor will work with you to provide referrals or additional resources where appropriate.</h2>
                <h2 className='question'>Do I have to be spiritual or practice religion to receive counseling services from Transformed Within, LLC?</h2>
                <h2 className='answer'>No; you do not have to practice, believe in, or have any spiritual or religious background to seek services with Transformed Within, LLC. Faith will never be pushed on any client for any reason. Faith-based, Christian counseling is offered as an option for those who would like to have their beliefs considered and incorporated into therapeutic techniques or as a lens through which the counselor understands the client’s presenting issues.</h2>
                <h2 className='question'>Parents of adolescents seeking faith-based services for your child, please note: </h2>
                <h2 className='answer'>I will respect your desire and wishes for faith to be incorporated into your child’s therapy work; however, counseling is not to be used as a tool to push your child into any religious beliefs or practices. Trying to force this can do more harm than good and is a violation of my professional and ethical practices. I am happy to incorporate faith into the therapeutic process where appropriate and to the extent the adolescent is comfortable or open to. If you have questions about this, please call or email to set up a time where we can further discuss this.</h2>
                <h2 className='question'>What is Christian counseling?</h2>
                <h2 className='answer'>Christian counseling is counseling conducted in a manner that acknowledges, understands, and utilizes Christian teachings and values to further the therapeutic process. This may present in several ways: Christian teachings on how to view and understand suffering, scripturally based guidance on how to live life in order to honor God and find happiness and peace, as a source of hope and encouragement, and as a source for relationships or connection to community, to name a few characteristics. These elements are used to enhance, not take the place of, traditional, researched, and professionally approved counseling standards, techniques, and expectations. All professional and ethical guidelines are adhered to when providing Christian counseling.</h2>
                <h2 className='question'>Do you accept insurance?</h2>
                <h2 className='answer'>Insurance is not accepted as a means of payment for counseling services with Transformed Within, LLC.</h2>
                <h2 className='question'>Do you offer a sliding scale?</h2>
                <h2 className='answer'>I am able to see a limited number of clients who may need a sliding scale. Please call, email, or use the Contact feature to get more information and to check availability for this service.</h2>
